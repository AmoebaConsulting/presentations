## Importance of the Youth Movement
 * Youth movements promote and enact the most influential, positive, powerful changes in our society
 * No social justice reform movement ever succeeded without a youth movement
 * There’s a reason: training the leaders of tomorrow, who in turn engage their peers
 * SSDP is cross-political: conservatives, liberals, law students, doctors, scientists
 * Empowering students with skills beyond drug policy

Throughout American history, it's been the young people that have promoted and enacted the most influential, positive and powerful  changes in our society: whether you’re talking about the civil rights movement, or any other social justice movement. And that’s what makes a social justice movement succeed. None of them have ever succeeded without a big bold student movement. We’ve got a movement, we’re growing and we’re taking over.
And there’s a good reason for this: when we train the leaders of tomorrow, they return to their communities, and train their peers
And ultimately some of these future leaders will enter politics in their lives
SSDP is a great example... is cross-political: conservatives, liberals, law students, doctors
The skills students learn take them beyond drug policy
SSDP alumni have gone on to start companies, not just engage in policy work. But many alumni also move on to political careers
